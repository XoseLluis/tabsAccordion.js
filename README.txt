tabsAccordion.js

Working with jquery UI sometimes I've hesitated between using an accordion or tabs to lay out some data. In both cases the information to be displayed consists of headers and contents, so though the html tags expected by jquery UI to create tabs or accordions are different, it should be pretty simple to switch from one to another.
That's what this small library does. In addition, it tries to beautify the transitions by showing and hiding the widgets using animations. You can use these animations (tabsAnimator and accordionAnimator) on their own, applying them to any tab or accordion.
